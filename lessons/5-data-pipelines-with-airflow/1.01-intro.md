# Data Pipelines

- A series of steps in which data is processed
- Executed in schedule, triggered externally or by events
- Typically using ETL or ELT

## Data validation

- The process of ensuring that data is present, correct & meaningful
- Ensuring the quality of your data through automated validation checks is a critical step in building data pipelines at any organization
- Preferably automated
- E.g. number of rows, values in range, any data produced at all

# DAGs - direct acyclic graph

#### Definitions

-   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs): DAGs are a special subset of graphs in which the edges between nodes have a specific direction, and no cycles exist. When we say "no cycles exist" what we mean is the nodes cant create a path back to themselves.
-   Nodes: A step in the data pipeline process.
-   Edges: The dependencies or relationships other between nodes.
